1. Problem Statement
     ●	In today's digital age, social media platforms are a primary outlet for individuals to express their thoughts, emotions, and opinions. Understanding these sentiments at scale can provide critical insights into public mood, brand perception, political stance, and more.

Type of Problem:
    ●	This is a multi-class classification problem where the goal is to categorize social media posts into predefined sentiment/emotion categories based on textual content.
            
Importance and Impact:  
    •	Solving this problem enables organizations to better engage with their audience, governments to monitor public reaction to policies, and mental health researchers to track emotional well-being trends. This application is especially relevant in the domains of marketing, social research, and digital mental health

 2. Project Objectives
    ●	Design and implement an automated system capable of analyzing vast volumes of textual data from social media platforms to detect and interpret the underlying sentiments and emotions expressed by users. Specify what the model aims to achieve
EX: accuracy, interpretability, real-world applicability

1. Collecting and processing real-time social media data from platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or Instagram using APIs or web scraping techniques.

2. Preprocessing unstructured text data to remove noise such as URLs, emojis, hashtags, and irrelevant content, ensuring the data is suitable for analysis.

3. Performing sentiment analysis to categorize text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using rule-based and machine learning models.

4. Decoding emotional states such as joy, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, or disgust by leveraging deep learning models or pretrained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).

5. Visualizing insights through interactive dashboards or graphical reports to present trends, emotional distribution, and patterns over time.

6. Applying insights to real-world scenarios such as brand reputation analysis, public opinion tracking, political sentiment evaluation, or mental health monitoring.

GOAL: 
	    Public Sentiment: Analyzing user-generated content Understanding to gauge    collective emotions on various topics.

	    Insights: Helping companies understand customer feedback and improve products/services. 

	      Real-time Monitoring: Tracking sentiment changes over time to predict trends.

4.Data Description o
f data: Unstructured text data
	The dataset used for this project consists of user-generated social media content collected primarily from the Twitter API using tools such as Tweepy and snscrape. This dataset reflects a range of user sentiments expressed through short-form text (tweets) relevant to trending topics.

	Dataset name and origin: Twitter Sentiment Dataset (collected via Twitter API)

	Type of data: Unstructured text data

	Number of records and features: Approximately 100,000 tweets with features including text, user metadata, timestamp, and sentiment label

	Static or dynamic dataset: Dynamic (data can continuously be updated via ADataset name and origin: Twitter Sentiment Dataset (collected via Twitter API)

Type of data: Unstructured text data

 5. Data Preprocessing
	Handle missing values (removal, imputation, etc.)
	Remove or justify duplicate records
	Detect and treat outliers
	Convert data types and ensure consistency
	Encode categorical variables (label encoding, one-hot encoding)
	Normalize or standardize features where required
	Document and explain each transformation step clearly in code 
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	Univariate Analysis:Distribution of features using histograms, boxplots, countplots, etc.
	Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:Correlation matrix, heatplots, scatterplots (grouped by target variable).
	Analysis of relationships between features and the target variable.
	Insights Summary:Highlight patterns, trends, and interesting observations.
7. Feature Engineering
	Create new features based on domain knowledge or EDA insights.
	Combine or split columns (e.g., extract date parts).
	Use techniques like binning, polynomial features, ratios, etc.
	Apply dimensionality reduction (optional, e.g., PCA).
	Justify each feature added or removed.
8. Model Building 

	Select and implement at least 2 machine learning models.
E.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, etc.
	Justify why these models were selected (based on problem type and data).
	Split data into training and testing sets (with stratification if needed).
	Train models and evaluate initial performance using appropriate metrics:
	For classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
	For regression: MAE, RMSE, R² score
9. Visualization of Results & Model Insights
	Performance Comparison:Plot confusion matrices for classification mdels.
	Show actual vs predicted plots for regression models.
	Feature Importance:Visualize feature importance (e.g., from Decision Trees, Random Forest).
	Use SHAP values or LIME for model interpretability.
	Residual Analysis (for regression):
	Plot residuals vs predicted values.
	Look for patterns that indicate bias or non-linearity.
	Error Analysis:Analyze and visualize misclassifications or high-error predictions.
10. Tools and Technologies Used
	Programming Language:
	Python (main language used for data handling, analysis, modeling)
	Libraries and Frameworks:
	Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
	Modeling & ML: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Keras/TensorFlow (if deep learning used)
	Model Explainability: SHAP, LIMED
	imensionality Reduction: PCA from sklearn.decomposition
	IDE & Environment:Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS Code
	Version Control:Git & GitHub (for code versioning and collaboration)
